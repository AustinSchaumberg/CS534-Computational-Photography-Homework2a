% The identified artifact is located at the bottom left corner of the original 
% photo. There's a blue crayon sandwiched between a yellow crayon (to the 
% left of it and a green crayon to the right). At the base of the blue 
% crayon's tip, closest to the crayon's paper 'wrapper', there is a white 
% line. Since the line's an edge neighboring an intense blue and white 
% (the white seems like a tear in the crayon's wrapper); the interpolation
% combines colors, equating to a lightened blue. Hence, after running the 
% MatLab function, it depicts the artifact around edge of this coloration
% irregularity.
